# Recipe_WebScraper
Used to scrape data from budgetbytes for several recipes based on user's choice.
All the recipes in the given URL (category of recipes) are compared with each other to segregate which recipes have the most common ingredients.


A later version of this project will include a GUI to make user experience better.


An example of the kind of url needed to be entered here is: https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/global/asian/
